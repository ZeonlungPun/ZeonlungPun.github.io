## 🛠 Projects
### Seed counting software based on object detection       基於目標檢測技術的種子計數軟件


Developed a Seed counting software for company daily use with  **Object detection** technique. The size of input image is 3840x2880.
- For the seeds of millet which are small relate to the image size, we firstly croped the large-size image into a standard size of **640x640**, and then train a **Yolov8-s model** with error less than **5%**.
- For the seeds of rice which are long strip, we trained a **Yolov7 oriented model** with error less than **5%**.
- For the seeds of soybeans, corn, sorghum, cucumbers and wheat,  we trained a **Yolov8-s model**  with error less than **3%**.

Recognition rate: On a 10th-generation i3 device with a CPU of 1,000 grains/image, millet takes less than **15 seconds**, rice takes less than **3 seconds**, and other crops take less than **2 seconds**.

### Orchard kiwi fruit counting pieline based on YOLOV8 and DeepSORT  基於YOLOV8和DeepSORT模型的果園奇異果計數（產量估計）

Developed an orchard kiwi fruit counting pieline  based on YOLOV8 and DeepSORT. The pieline can directly use video to automatically count kiwi fruits in the orchard and estimate yield automatically. Compared with manual counting, the accuracy of this system reaches more than **90%**.

### Food classification software based on ResNet-50    基於ResNet-50模型的食物分類軟件
Developed a Food classification software using ResNet-50 classfication Neural Network. There are 99 kinds of food in total in the dataset and the **Top-5 accuracy** is around **70%**.

### Application of Machine Learning in the field of Genomic Selection   機器學習在全基因組選擇中的應用
Evaluated feature importance using SHAP algorithm, and the most important 3000 are selected from 9000 independent variables, and these 4000 independent variables are used for modeling. This approach can not only reduce memory consumption and save model training time, but also slightly improve the prediction accuracy of the model.
